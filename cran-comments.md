## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 notes

The NOTE is about the package size which is 5MB. I anticipate the size will be 
reduced in future releases after the embedded data is moved to a different package.

RCMD check passed on the following Github Actions runners
  - {os: macOS-latest,   r: 'release'}
  - {os: windows-latest, r: 'release'}
  - {os: ubuntu-latest,   r: 'release'}
  - {os: ubuntu-latest,   r: 'devel'}
