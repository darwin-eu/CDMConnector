\title{Build a Synthetic CDM from a Cohort Set}
\usage{
cdmFromCohortSet(cohortSet, n = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{cohortSet}{A data frame (usually from \code{CDMConnector::readCohortSet()})
with columns \code{cohort_definition_id}, \code{cohort_name}, and \code{cohort}
(cohort definition as a list or JSON string).}

\item{n}{Integer. Total number of synthetic persons to generate across all cohorts.
Defaults to 100.}
}
\value{
A cdm reference object (as returned by \code{CDMConnector::cdmFromCon()}) backed
by a DuckDB database. The returned object contains synthetic CDM tables and
cohort table rows generated from the specified cohort definitions.
}
\description{
Constructs a synthetic OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) using a set of cohort definitions,
typically created using \code{CDMConnector::readCohortSet()}. The function generates
synthetic data and returns a cdm reference object backed by a DuckDB database,
containing synthetic CDM tables and generated cohort table rows.

library(CDMConnector)
cohortSet <- readCohortSet(system.file("cohorts", package = "CDMConnector"))
cdm <- cdmFromCohortSet(cohortSet, n = 100)
cdm$person
