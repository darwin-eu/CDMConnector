\title{Generate a cohort set on a cdm object}
\usage{
generateCohortSet(
  cdm,
  cohortSet,
  name,
  computeAttrition = TRUE,
  overwrite = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cdm}{A cdm reference created by CDMConnector. write_schema must be
specified.}

\item{cohortSet}{A cohortSet dataframe created with \code{readCohortSet()}}

\item{name}{Name of the cohort table to be created. This will also be used
as a prefix for the cohort attribute tables. This must be a lowercase character string
that starts with a letter and only contains letters, numbers, and underscores.}

\item{computeAttrition}{Should attrition be computed? TRUE (default) or FALSE}

\item{overwrite}{Should the cohort table be overwritten if it already
exists? TRUE (default) or FALSE}
}
\description{
A "cohort_table" object consists of four components
\itemize{
\item{A remote table reference to an OHDSI cohort table with at least
the columns: cohort_definition_id, subject_id, cohort_start_date,
cohort_end_date. Additional columns are optional and some analytic
packages define additional columns specific to certain analytic
cohorts.}
\item{A \strong{settings attribute} which points to a remote table containing
cohort settings including the names of the cohorts.}
\item{An \strong{attrition attribute} which points to a remote table with
attrition information recorded during generation. This attribute is
optional. Since calculating attrition takes additional compute it
can be skipped resulting in a NULL attrition attribute.}
\item{A \strong{cohortCounts attribute} which points to a remote table
containing cohort counts}
}

Each of the three attributes are tidy tables. The implementation of this
object is experimental and user feedback is welcome.

\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}
One key design principle is that cohort_table objects are created once
and can persist across analysis execution but should not be modified after
creation. While it is possible to modify a cohort_table object doing
so will invalidate it and it's attributes may no longer be accurate.
