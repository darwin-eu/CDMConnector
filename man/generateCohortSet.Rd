\title{Generate a cohort set on a cdm object}
\usage{
generateCohortSet(
  cdm,
  cohortSet,
  name = "cohort",
  computeAttrition = FALSE,
  overwrite = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cdm}{A cdm reference created by CDMConnector. write_schema must be
specified.}

\item{cohortSet}{A cohortSet object created with \code{readCohortSet()}.}

\item{name}{Name of the cohort table to be created. This will also be used
as a prefix for the cohort attribute tables.}

\item{computeAttrition}{Should attrition be computed? TRUE or FALSE (default)}

\item{overwrite}{Should the cohort table be overwritten if it already
exists? TRUE or FALSE (default)}
}
\description{
A "GeneratedCohortSet" object consists of several components
\itemize{
\item{A remote table reference to an OHDSI cohort table with at least
the columns: cohort_definition_id, subject_id, cohort_start_date,
cohort_end_date. Additional columns are optional and some analytic
packages define additional columns specific to certain analytic
cohorts.}
\item{A \strong{settings attribute} which points to a remote table containing
cohort settings including the names of the cohorts.}
\item{An \strong{attrition attribute} which points to a remote table with
attrition information recorded during generation. This attribute is
optional. Since calculating attrition takes additional compute it
can be skipped resulting in a NULL attrition attribute.}
\item{A \strong{cohortCounts attribute} which points to a remote table
containing cohort counts}
}

Each of the three attributes are tidy tables. The implementation of this
object is experimental and user feedback is welcome.

One key design principle is that GeneratedCohortSet objects are created once
and can persist across analysis execution but should not be modified after
creation. While it is possible to modify a GeneratedCohortSet object doing
so will invalidate it and it's attributes may no longer be accurate.
