\description{
It may be helpful to be able to easily copy a small test cdm from a local
database to a remote for testing. copyCdmTo takes a cdm object and a connection.
It copies the cdm to the remote database connection. CDM tables can be prefixed
in the new database allowing for multiple cdms in a single shared database
schema.
