> Are you using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) with an OMOP Common Data Model? 
>
> Interact with your CDM in a pipe-friendly way with CDMConnector.
>
> - Quickly connect to your CDM and start exploring.
> - Build data analysis pipelines using familiar dplyr verbs.
> - Easily extract subsets of CDM data from a database.


## Overview

CDMConnector introduces a single R object that represents an OMOP CDM relational database inspired by the [dm](https://cynkra.github.io/dm/), [DatabaseConnector](http://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector/), and [Andromeda](https://ohdsi.github.io/Andromeda/) packages. The cdm object can be used in dplyr style data analysis pipelines and facilitates interactive data exploration. cdm objects encapsulate references to [OMOP CDM tables](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/) in a remote RDBMS as well as metadata necessary for interacting with a CDM.

## Features

CDMConnector is meant to be the entry point for composable tidyverse style data analysis operations on an OMOP CDM. 
A `cdm_reference` object behaves like a named list of tables.

- Quickly create a list of references to a subset of CDM tables
- Store connection information for later use inside functions
- Use any DBI driver back-end with the OMOP CDM

See Getting started for more details.


## Installation

CDMConnector can be installed from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("CDMConnector")
```

The development version can be installed from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("darwin-eu/CDMConnector")
```

## Usage

Create a `cdm_reference` object from any DBI connection. Use the `cdm_schema argument to point to a particular schema in your database.

```{r}
library(CDMConnector)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), dbdir = eunomia_dir())
cdm <- cdm_from_con(con, cdm_schema = "main")
cdm
```

A `cdm_reference` is a named list of table references:

```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
names(cdm)
```

Use dplyr verbs with the table references.

```{r}
tally(cdm$person)
```

Compose operations with the pipe.

```{r}
cdm$condition_era %>%
  left_join(cdm$concept, by = c("condition_concept_id" = "concept_id")) %>% 
  count(top_conditions = concept_name, sort = TRUE)
```

Run a simple quality check on a cdm.

```{r}
cdm <- cdm_from_con(con, cdm_tables = c("person", "observation_period"))
validate_cdm(cdm)
```


```{r, include=FALSE}
DBI::dbDisconnect(con)
```

## DBI Drivers

CDMConnector is tested using the following DBI driver backends:

- [RPostgres](https://rpostgres.r-dbi.org/reference/postgres) on Postgres and Redshift
- [odbc](https://solutions.rstudio.com/db/r-packages/odbc/) on Microsoft SQL Server
- [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/r) 


## Getting help

If you encounter a clear bug, please file an issue with a minimal [reproducible example](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) on [GitHub](https://github.com/OdyOSG/CDMConnector/issues).
